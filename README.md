140. Introduction
    1. use reactive forms
        * reactive form are build around observable streams 
        * but forms inputs and values can be accessed synchronously
        * they are easy to test because they are detached from the html and act as separated objects
        * all the cool kids are using reactive forms
    2. use angualr validation for inputs
    3. implement custom validators
    4. implement resumable form controls (be a bit more DRY)
    5. working with Date inputs
