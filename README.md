    2. creating components (cli)
    3. using angular template forms
    4. angular services
    5. observables
    6. structural directives
    7. component communication parent <=> child using input/output

48. Creating a nav bar
49. Introduction to Angular template forms
50. Introduction to Angular services
51. Injecting services into components
52. Using conditionals to show and remove content

55. Persisting the login
56. Using the async pipe
57. Adding a home page

62. Section 5 summary

    1. implemented the register functionality.
    2. creating components
    3. forms => two way binding
    4. angular services for sharing data => singletons in their provided scope
    5. observables, async pipes for subscribing/unsubscribing to observables
    6. structural directives => conditionally rendering elements 
    7. parent child communication => Input/Output
